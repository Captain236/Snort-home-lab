# Intusion Detection Using Snort
## What is intrusion detection system (IDS)?
=> Intrusion detection system is a device or a software that intercept all inbound or outbound traffic  of network for suspecious pattern
- IDS is placed inside or outside the firewall
- Checks traffic for signature that match known intrusion patterns and signal an alarm

## What is Snort?
=> Snort is an open source IDS . Snort have ips capability that can detect monitor suspecious anomaly behviour in the network
- Snort can help us to detect any suspecious activity in the network level like web based attack , wifi etc.
- capability:-
- (1) Real Time Monetoring
- (2) Packet Logging
- (3) OS Fingerprinting
- (4) protocol support

## Objective of this project :-
(1) Understand Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):
Learn the role of Snort as an IDS and its importance in network security.

(2) Install and Configure Snort:
Set up Snort in your home lab and configure it to monitor network traffic.

(3) Write  Snort Rules:
Create basic rules to detect common network patterns like  ssh , icmp ping requests.

(4) Capture and Analyze Alerts:
Generate traffic  and observe how Snort detects and logs activities.

(5) Familiarize with Snort Logging:
Understand how Snort logs alerts and review these logs for insights.

## Skill Learned :-
(*) Network Traffic Monitoring:
Understand how to capture and analyze network packets.

(*)Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Basics:
Learn the principles of IDS and how Snort functions as one.

(*)Snort Installation and Configuration:
Gain practical experience setting up and configuring Snort for various network environments.

(*)Rule Creation and Management:
Write and manage Snort rules to detect specific network activities or threats.

(*)Log Analysis:
Interpret and analyze Snort alert logs to identify security incidents.

(*)Network Protocol Understanding:
Deepen your knowledge of protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and ICMP while working with traffic data.

## Let's Begin....

## Step 1 :-
- First we need to install the snort on ubuntu machine .
- open the ubuntu terminal and make sure every package is update and upgrade . for this ( Type "sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade") and hit enter
